        "location": "Peak located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas on the border of Nepal and China.",
        "facts": "An expedition in 1924 resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at 8,155 m (26,755 ft) on the north face. Officially, the peak was first reached by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Sherpa of Nepal Tenzing Norgay in 1953.",

There are several debates on where exactly this point lies, depending on how the coastline is defined. In 2007, <a href='http://diapiro.ictja.csic.es/gt/danielgc/papers/Garcia-Castellanos,%20Lombardo,%202007,%20SGJ.pdf' target='_blank'>this study</a> concluded that the Gulf of Ob is part of the ocean and this new pole was established to be the furthest from the ocean.",
